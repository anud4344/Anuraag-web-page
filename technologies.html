          Project 1
          <p>
            Developed Wordle Game using Java, JavaFX and Scene builder. This is
            similar to Boogle where you do not know the letters, but it is a 5
            letter word. The game involves creating a Grid pane with 5 rows, 5
            columns and allowing the user to guess the randomly generated word
            hidden behind. It keeps a tab of the scores for each player with a
            reset button to restart the game. Buttons were added to warn the
            user if he fills a cell already filled and lets them try again. The
            program uses Data structure to collect player data and keeps a log
            of player moves. It uses lot of interactive GUI components
            components like Event handlers, hover buttons, controllers for
            buttons.

            Developed my Resume by creating a layout and then used HTML to
            create the content of the index page, followed by four other linking
            HTML pages namely Technical Portfolio, Qualifications, Services and
            Artificial Intelligence generated resume page. The HTML pages were
            provided with features to navigate from one page to the next or
            previous pages. Used CSS to develop the styling for each of these
            pages and finally used Java Script to add GUI features like toggle
            to change the style. This was a four week project.

          Project 4 (Planned)
          <p>
            Dengue is prevalent in India, and I know an individual who cannot
            afford money to pay for a website but wants to advertise his small
            home run business of installing different types of net to prevent
            mosquitoes entering homes with which he makes his livelihood. Intend
            to create an interactive web page for this individual free of cost
            to help him sustain his living. This web page will show the features
            of his different netting patterns and styles he can build, material
            used, allow customers to make a request for a quote and provide an
            immediate on-line quotation with cost. It will also have features to
            look at his calendar to book a day slot for his business. The
            website will show the reviews he has received as well.
			
			Also, intend to create an App to publish doctors and medical facilities in
            the neighborhood with the fees they charge without insurance.
