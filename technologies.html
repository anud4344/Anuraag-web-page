          <p>
            As a part of Internship with HCL Technologies Ltd, India created an AI based App to claim Lottery prize money. The Front End was created using React with mobile net model to do a first pass classification of the ticket image uploaded, Tesseract OCR was used extract the data from the image, and htmlqr5code was used to extract the ticket ID from the bar code in the ticket image. The Back End server hosts a winning ticket table on PostgreSQL which will be used by the backend server built on Node JS using Express as a middleware and determine if the ticket is a winning ticket to allow mobile claim.

          <p>
            Created a POS Inventory system to reduce overhead, track customer orders to analyze ordering trends and restock inventory. Generated the database residing in AWS using Python script. Evaluated the database system using SQL queries for sales history, peak sales, menu item inventory. Implemented a GUI to support customer, cashier and manager for the purpose of submitting orders, updating items, prices, restock inventory, manage employees and create reports. The frontend was designed using React JS for building user interfaces, React Router for navigation between pages. The backend was built using Node JS for server logic and API calls, PostgreSQL for accessing data storage, Axios to handle API requests.

          <span class="project-title">Project 8:Wordle Game</span>
          <p>
            Developed Wordle Game using Java, JavaFX and Scene builder. This is
            similar to Boogle where you do not know the letters, but it is a 5
            letter word. The game involves creating a Grid pane with 5 rows, 5
            columns and allowing the user to guess the randomly generated word
            hidden behind. It keeps a tab of the scores for each player with a
            reset button to restart the game. Buttons were added to warn the
            user if he fills a cell already filled and lets them try again. The
            program uses Data structure to collect player data and keeps a log
            of player moves. It uses lot of interactive GUI components
            components like Event handlers, hover buttons, controllers for
            buttons.

          <p>
            Developed my Resume by creating a layout and then used HTML to
            create the content of the index page, followed by four other linking
            HTML pages namely Technical Portfolio, Qualifications, Services and
            Artificial Intelligence generated resume page. The HTML pages were
            provided with features to navigate from one page to the next or
            previous pages. Used CSS to develop the styling for each of these
            pages and finally used Java Script to add GUI features like toggle
            to change the style. This was a four week project.
